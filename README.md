# Deep-Learning

Now i'm in Summer vacation, so i decided to spend this period for studying my major deeper!
So i decided to learn and develope these things :

 1) Advanced skills for Python for Data science</br>
  Until summer vacation, i used to use R for analysing data & programming. It's a kinda basic tool for Data scinece. But if you want to    analyse much bigger data and handle it more widely, you have to use Python! 
  In my case, i learned basic Python skills 2 years ago, and use it when i do machine learning project in THUAS. But my skiils are not perfect so im gonna study it with coursera and guide books which i already had. 

 2) Studying Machine learning & Deep learning</br>
  Last semester i took Machine learning course in University. It was so difficult becasue of so many statical things but so useful and interesting. so i thought im gonna study it additionally with coursera. In coursera, i can learn basic theories and practice for programming skills with Python.
  

###
Here is the certificate that i completed the courses what i took for studying machine learning & deep learning. This courses are consist of lecture and assignments with python.</br>

* 1.- [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](Neural_Networks_and_Deep_Learning.pdf) - 19.7.22.

* 2.- [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization](Coursera_Improving_Deep_Neural_Networks.pdf) - 19.7.30.

* 3.- [Structuring_Machine_Learning_Projects](Coursera_Structuring_Machine_Learning_Projects.pdf)

* 4.- 

* 5.-
